## Where do we use npm ? (1/2)

* We are using `node_modules` for a lot of JS related stuff. For example, we use it for importing bootstrap, fontawesome, jquery, cookieconsent, etc.
* The full list stand in `package.json` in the `epfl-sti` theme folder.

## Where do we use npm ? (2/2)

* When we run `npm i` (or `npm install`), all the package listed in `package.json` are downloaded and installed into the `node_modules` folder.
